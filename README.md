Hi! I'm **People** this is the first game project I've made in Unity. It's supposed to be a "Jump King"-like game. Of course, it’s missing a lot of things and doesn’t even have a game menu yet, but it's a good start. I'll keep working on it and updating it until I finish. Feel free to download it!
Here's a video of the game. Also, if you want to download the game just to try it, I'll leave a link here for you to download it.

I don’t own any of the assets I used in the game. If you want to download them, I’ve included all of them here.
