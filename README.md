Hi! I'm People. This is the first game project I've made in Unity. It's meant to be a Jump King-like game. Of course, it's still missing a lot of features and doesn't even have a main menu yet â€” but I'll keep working on it and updating it until it's done. Feel free to try it out!

Here's a video of the game. And if youâ€™d like to download and play it, Iâ€™ve included a link below:
